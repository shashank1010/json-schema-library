 * remove from draft06

 * - propertyNames
 * - contains
 * - const
 * - format: uri-reference
 * - format: uri-template
 * - format: json-pointer
 * - examples: array of examples with no validation effect; the value of "default" is usable as an example without repeating it under this keyword
 *
 * revert from draft06
 * - $id replaces id
 * - $ref only allowed where a schema is expected
 * - "exclusiveMinimum" and exclusiveMaximum changed from a boolean to a number to be consistent with the principle of keyword independence

 * - required  allows an empty array
 * - dependencies allows an empty array for property dependencies
